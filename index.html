        <h3>Hello there. I do not know how or why you found this website. I would assume it's a typo [dont ask me how, i havent figured out the domain yet], but in the off chance it isn't, here is some stuff about me that you might be looking for.</p>
        <h4>Stuff you might want</h5>
        <ul>

            <li>my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuiVzHDsVbeoXr2spMgZ4Rw">youtube</a>, from back when i had an overinflated sense of self [if you're looking for video editors, I am not good but I will work my ass off]</li>

        </ul>
